![Supports aarch64 Architecture][aarch64-shield] ![Supports amd64 Architecture][amd64-shield]

Home Assistant add-on that uses [onnx-asr](https://github.com/guillaumekln/istupakov/onnx-asr/) for speech-to-text.

Notably, provides access to the [NVIDIA NeMo Parakeet-TDT](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/turbocharge-asr-accuracy-and-speed-with-nvidia-nemo-parakeet-tdt/) model which should be significantly faster and more accurate than Whisper for English.
